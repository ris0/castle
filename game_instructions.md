* At the beginning of the first round, rooms will be drawn into the market, and the master builder (indicated by the castle icon next to username) will reposition them.

## Gameplay
* At the beginning of each round, $1000 discounts are applied to rooms left in the market and new rooms are drawn to fill in empty prices.
* The master builder can drag and drop rooms to different prices and click 'MB Done' when they are finished.
* Each player takes a turn choosing a tile, including Stairs or Hallway, pays the master builder according to the room's value in the market and adds it to their castle.
* A player can also choose to pass and collect $5000.
* When the round comes back to the master builder, the master builder takes a turn buying. Their money is simply returned to the bank.
* This ends the turn and the next player becomes the master builder

## Scoring
* After placement, a room's placement points are added to the player's score. Each room is checked for its connections to other rooms and synergy points are assessed for the just placed room as well as all rooms it's connected to.
* Each room is also checked against global point bonuses that come from downstairs rooms.
* Rooms are also checked for completion (all doors connected to other doors) and bonuses are awarded for room completion.

## Completion Bonuses
* Activity Room: +5 points to player's score
* Outdoor Room: +$10000 to player's bank
* Food Room: One bonus turn
* Corridor Room: One bonus stair or hallway placement (only one per turn)
* Sleep Room: Draw 0, 1, or 2 room tiles from any one size of room tile to add to the top of room card draw pile. If the room card pile is empty, players do not play another round.
* Downstairs Room: For every two downstairs rooms completed, players may choose another bonus to redeem.
* Utility Room: Draw two bonus cards and discard one

## King's Favors
* King's Favors scores are totaled at the end of the game, but a tally of current standings is kept in the carousel below players' scorecards.
