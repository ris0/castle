For our final project, our team decided to build Castles, a digital implementation of the board game Castles of Mad King Ludwig. The objective of the game is to acquire the most points by building a castle, room by room, over the course of the game. It has a wide variety of events which can increase or even decrease a player's score. Each player needs to keep track of not only the points the different scoring elements which can be rather tedious.

As students of JavaScript for only 3 short months, we believe that our project was an incredibly rewarding experience. It resulted in us having a much deeper understanding of JavaScript, Angular, Firebase, and D3. More importantly, we had a lot of fun coding and learning together while building this project. It was certainly an experience we will remember for a long time.
