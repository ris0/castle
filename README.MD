Castles is a web-based multiplayer digital implementation of the board game Castles of Mad King Ludwig. The objective of the game is to acquire the most points by building a castle, room by room, over the course of the game. Scoring is both complex and tedious, as a wide variety of events can either increase or decrease a player's score, making it tedious to accurately keep track of. Castles solves this problem by handling the time-consuming aspects of the original board game, and in turn, allowing users to focus on strategizing.

Our team believes that building Castles was an incredibly rewarding experience. The development process deepened our understanding of JavaScript, Angular, Firebase, and opened our eyes to the power of D3. Most importantly, we had a lot of fun coding and learning together while building this project.
